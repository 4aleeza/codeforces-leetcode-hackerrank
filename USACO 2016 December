/*As part of an adventurous road trip, Abdul Ahad and Abdul Rafay are traveling across the country, 
exploring various cities and discovering hidden connections between them. 
While marking their route on a giant map, they notice an interesting pattern: 
some cities seem to share a unique link based on their names and state codes.
For example, they realize that driving from Flint, MI to Miami, 
FL feels almost poetic— the first two letters of "Flint" form the state code ("FL") for Miami, 
and the first two letters of "Miami" form the state code ("MI") for Flint.
They define two cities as a "special pair" if they follow this pattern and belong to different states. 
Now, as they cruise along highways and scenic routes, 
they start wondering—how many such special pairs of cities exist? 
Help them solve this intriguing travel puzzle!*/
